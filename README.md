# Credits

The usb-hid library for Android and the initial structure of the FHAU Android app are based on the 
following upstream GitHub repository:
https://github.com/benlypan/UsbHid
The Android app has since been modified extensively and I now regard it as original work in this
repository, but the usb-hid directory has very few changes relative to @benlypan's original work.

README-usbhid.md in this repository contains the original README of the upstream repository.

The upstream repository has not been updated since 2017, but I have a public fork of that 
repository in which the build tools have been updated to Android SDK 35 (current stable
SDK as at early December 2024):
https://github.com/tim-littlefair/UsbHid

See the README.md in the fork repository for details of other changes made to the original
upstream application.

The current launch icon for the project is based on the following graphic, accessed under Vecteezy's
